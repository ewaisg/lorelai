Creating a Foundry resource unlocks access to models, agents, and tools through a unified set of SDKs and endpoints. This article covers what each SDK is for and which endpoint to use.

| SDK                    | What it's for                                                                                                                                               | Endpoint                                                                    |

<Callout type="note">
  **Resource types:** A Foundry resource provides all endpoints previously listed. An Azure OpenAI resource provides only the `/openai/v1` endpoint.

  **Authentication:** Samples here use Microsoft Entra ID (`DefaultAzureCredential`). API keys work on `/openai/v1`. Pass the key as `api_key` instead of a token provider.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free Azure account, which includes a free trial subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

* Have one of the following Azure RBAC roles to create and manage Foundry resources:

  * **Azure AI User** (least-privilege role for development)
  * **Azure AI Project Manager** (for managing Foundry projects)
  * **Contributor** or **Owner** (for subscription-level permissions)

  For details on each role's permissions, see [Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/rbac-azure-ai-foundry).

* Install the required language runtimes, global tools, and VS Code extensions as described in [Prepare your development environment](install-cli-sdk).

<Callout type="important">
  Before starting, make sure your development environment is ready.\
  This article focuses on **scenario-specific steps** like SDK installation, authentication, and running sample code.
</Callout>

## Foundry SDK

The Foundry SDK connects to a single project endpoint that provides access to the most popular Foundry capabilities:

```
https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>
```

<Callout type="note">
  If your organization uses a custom subdomain, replace `<resource-name>` with `<your-custom-subdomain>` in the endpoint URL.
</Callout>

This simplifies application configuration. Instead of managing multiple endpoints, you configure one.

### Install the SDK

<Callout type="note">
  **SDK versions:** The 2.x preview SDK targets the new Foundry portal and API. The 1.x GA SDK targets Foundry classic. Make sure the samples you follow match your installed package.

### Using the Foundry SDK

The SDK exposes two client types because Foundry and OpenAI have different API shapes:

* **Project client** – Use for Foundry-native operations where OpenAI has no equivalent. Examples: listing connections, retrieving project properties, enabling tracing.
* **OpenAI-compatible client** – Use for Foundry functionality that builds on OpenAI concepts. The Responses API, agents, evaluations, and fine-tuning all use OpenAI-style request/response patterns. This client also gives you access to Foundry direct models (non-Azure-OpenAI models hosted in Foundry). The project endpoint serves this traffic on the `/openai` route.

Most apps use both clients. Use the project client for setup and configuration, then use the OpenAI-compatible client for running agents, evaluations, and calling models (including Foundry direct models).

<ZonePivot pivot="programming-language-python">
  **Create a project client:**

  ```python

    credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
  ```

  **Create an OpenAI-compatible client from your project:**

  ```python
  openai_client = project.inference.get_azure_openai_client(api_version="2024-10-21")
  response = openai_client.responses.create(

### What you can do with the Foundry SDK

* [Access Foundry Models](../../quickstarts/get-started-code), including Azure OpenAI
* [Use the Foundry Agent Service](../../../ai-services/agents/quickstart?context=/azure/ai-foundry/context/context)
* [Run cloud evaluations](cloud-evaluation)
* [Enable app tracing](../../concepts/trace)
* [Fine-tune a model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?view=foundry\&tabs=azure-openai\&pivots=programming-language-python\&preserve-view=true)
* Get endpoints and keys for Foundry Tools, local orchestration, and more

## OpenAI SDK

Use the OpenAI SDK when you want the full OpenAI API surface and maximum client compatibility. This endpoint provides access to Azure OpenAI models and Foundry direct models (via Chat Completions API). It does not provide access to Foundry-specific features like agents and evaluations.

### Create an OpenAI client from your project

<ZonePivot pivot="programming-language-python">
  This snippet uses the `AIProjectClient` to request an OpenAI client from your Foundry project.

  ```python
  # Use the AIProjectClient to create an OpenAI client for your project
  openai_client = project.get_openai_client()
  response = openai_client.responses.create(
      model="gpt-5.2",
      input="What is the size of France in square miles?",
  )
  print(f"Response output: {response.output_text}")
  ```

  The following snippet shows how to use the Azure OpenAI `/openai/v1` endpoint directly.

  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI
  from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider

  token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
      DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
  )

  client = OpenAI(  
    base_url = "https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/",  
    api_key=token_provider,
  )

  response = client.responses.create(
      model="model_deployment_name",
      input= "What is the size of France in square miles?" 
  )

  print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2)) 
  ```

  1. Install the OpenAI package:

     Run this command to add the OpenAI client library to your .NET project.

     ```bash

  When it succeeds, the .NET CLI confirms that it installed the `OpenAI` package.

  1. The following code snippet demonstrates how to create the OpenAI client directly using the Azure OpenAI v1 endpoint.

     This snippet configures `DefaultAzureCredential`, builds `OpenAIClientOptions`, and creates a `ResponseClient` for the Azure OpenAI v1 endpoint.

     ResponseCreationOptions options = new ResponseCreationOptions

     OpenAIResponse modelDirectResponse = client.CreateResponse(
          [
             ResponseItem.CreateUserMessageItem("What is the size of France in square miles?"),

## Using the Agent Framework for local orchestration

Microsoft Agent Framework is an open-source SDK for building multi-agent systems in code (for example, .NET and Python) with a cloud-provider-agnostic interface.

Use Agent Framework when you want to define and orchestrate agents locally. Pair it with the Foundry SDK when you want those agents to run against Foundry models or when you want Agent Framework to orchestrate agents hosted in Foundry.

For more information, see the [Microsoft Agent Framework overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview).

## Foundry Tools SDKs

Foundry Tools (formerly Azure AI Services) are prebuilt point solutions with dedicated SDKs. Use the following endpoints to work with Foundry Tools.

### Which endpoint should you use?

Choose an endpoint based on your needs:

Use the Azure AI Services endpoint to access Computer Vision, Content Safety, Document Intelligence, Language, Translation, and Token Foundry Tools.

Foundry Tools endpoint: `https://<your-resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`

<Callout type="note">
  Endpoints use either your resource name or a custom subdomain. If your organization set up a custom subdomain, replace `your-resource-name` with `your-custom-subdomain` in all endpoint examples.
</Callout>

For Speech and Translation Foundry Tools, use the endpoints in the following tables. Replace placeholders with your resource information.

#### Speech Endpoints

| Foundry Tool              | Endpoint                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speech to Text (Standard) | `https://<YOUR-RESOURCE-REGION>.stt.speech.microsoft.com`   |
| Text to Speech (Neural)   | `https://<YOUR-RESOURCE-REGION>.tts.speech.microsoft.com`   |
| Custom Voice              | `https://<YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/` |

#### Translation Endpoints

| Foundry Tool         | Endpoint                                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text Translation     | `https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/`            |
| Document Translation | `https://<YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/` |
